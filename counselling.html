            <p><strong>Pre-marital</strong> counselling sessions help to make sure that you and your spouse can have a strong and healthy relationship throughout your life. Minimal time investment in the form of these sessions helps eliminate a lot to trouble post marriage and avoid mental stress for both the parties involved</p>
            <p><strong>post-marital</strong> counseling helps a couple to address and voice out their ‘individual’ opinion about the relationship in a safe environment. We ensure you have the confidence to be yourself without the fear of being judged or blamed for a conflict in the marriage. Most of the post-marital problems get solved once you’re able to establish an effective ‘2-Way Communication’ and our counselling sessions help you achieve this goal seamlessly.</p>

            <h3>Divorce Counseling:)</h3>
            <p>Sometimes it’s better to part ways in an appropriate manner. There are some relations that are broken irretrievably however the underlying issues are never discussed. This creates a hostile environment for both the parties and leads to further trouble which sometimes is intensely damaging. A counsellor can help distressed couple balance their mental health and make them aware of possible problems in future. Our sessions for such couples help them attain a civil & healthy divorce. Divorce leaves most of the individuals with an emotional turmoil limiting their ability to think reasonably and resolve tangles on their own. Divorce counselling becomes a necessity in such cases. It helps you rationally sail through your emotions and problems to overcome and achieve mental health and social connect </p>

            <h3>School Counseling:)</h3>
            <p>Children always have a lot of logical questions relating to their surroundings. It’s important that their queries are addressed in a timely manner. School counseling helps fostering the teacher-student relationship which develops a comfortable environment for children's ability to speak up and ask queries.  Every educational institution has its own goals that can be achieved if you have the children's ability to open up and state their opinion. These sessions aim to help the child progress and maintain discipline at the same time.</p><hr>
